Before suspending the sitting for a couple of minutes until the arrival of our guests, I wish to welcome a delegation from the Syrian Parliament, led by Mr Suleiman Haddad, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Syrian People's Assembly, which is here as part of our 10th EP/Syria Interparliamentary Meeting.
The Council, loyally expressing the anti-grassroots policy of the European Union and the interests of capital, is implementing all the demands of operators and shipowners and of the monopoly business groups which oppose any measure which might even minimally affect their profitability.
These are: data collection, research, internal cooperation, the administration of fishing matters, and common fisheries policy monitoring systems.
The economic crisis and the rise in the price of oil are having more drastic effects on the air transport system than we have ever experienced before.
on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, I have the impression that the aim here is, as they say in Westphalia, to throw a sausage after a side of bacon, meaning to throw out a herring to catch a whale.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, the right to unrestricted education, which means the right of access to education, is enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and yet it is still deficient and has still not been fully realised in practice.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - Mr President, I will speak in English in honour of our rapporteur.
Public authorities may be considerably assisted by the participation of universities and research institutes.
In this regard, I condemn the recent events in Novi Sad, where a neo-Nazi organisation attacked a peaceful gathering of individuals who had gathered for an anti-fascist demonstration.
The text adopted today also includes the two main priorities of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE): it removes any reference to additional documents and requests Member States to draw up 'correlation tables' enabling the Commission to verify the transposition of the directive.
The Commission estimates that the current RoHS Directive has led to a reduction of 100 000 tonnes of certain heavy metals and two groups of brominated flame retardants from going into the waste stream and potentially entering the environment.
This project has produced an operational definition of a closed aquaculture facility, which tightens up and enlarges upon the definition currently in use and embodies an approach whereby the degree of risk associated with alien species could be reduced considerably.
I think that the potential existence and extraction of shale gas in Europe must not be ignored and I expect the Commission to prepare a technical and economic study on the feasibility of extraction.
Of course, the three rapporteurs are most deserving of credit, as also is the Chairman of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, our fellow Member Mr Reul, and Vice-President of Parliament, Mr Vidal-Quadras, who chaired the EP delegation to the Conciliation Committee.
Moreover, we feel that it is going to protect not only the people of the Member States, but also people who come from outside the European Union and have the status of a foreign resident, because the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights protects anyone who is under the jurisdiction of a Member State and in the future anyone who is under jurisdiction that is affected by the decisions taken by the European Union.
In our report we therefore ask the Commission to carry out a proper impact study, which must also include a component correctly ascertaining the original market conditions and assess the integration and competitiveness of the market and the impact of an initiative not just by means of one indicator but by the largest possible number of measurements.
It was indeed about the deposit guarantee schemes.
As a member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I consider the first precondition to be the recognition of the university education of highly qualified persons or three years' experience.
The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic has suspended talks on the ratification of the Agreement until such time as there is clear progress by the Commission in talks with Canada over ending the unilateral visa requirement for Czech citizens.
We can only regret our failure to do so, but I do welcome Mr Verheugen's announcement that the matter is to be the subject of in-depth study, for that is certainly what we need.
That is why we need to amend the 2002 Directive, so as to create the necessary instruments to deal with this form of cyberterrorism.
There is an inherent conflict of interest if market participants devise internal credit risk assessments for their own regulatory capital requirements.
These technologies can be the driving forces behind greater productivity, growth and cost reductions that make for competitiveness, sustainable development and the improvement of EU citizens' quality of life.
We currently have in front of us the reports on the rating agencies and on the Capital Requirements Directive and one comitology proposal.
In my view, the major challenges of the attempted reform are threefold.
It is the result of cooperation within the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and also the result of compromises to give the report wider support.
The idea is to further knowledge through research, dissemination and transfer of technologies.
in writing. - (SK) The Commission has presented us with the Green Paper on the European Research Area at a time when Europe faces an unending transatlantic drain of investment and qualified researchers.
First of all, I wish to thank the rapporteurs from the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and the associated Committee on Employment and Social Affairs respectively for their report.
Subject: Measures to stimulate investment in increasing energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies
I express my support for the recommendation to improve the energy efficiency of buildings.
It is good that the agreement introduces provisions concerning mutual assistance, coordination of implementation actions, exchange of information and guarantee of confidentiality.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Commission, and of President Barroso, I should like to make a few comments about the 2020 strategy and echo the very interesting reports from Mr Grech and Mr Hoang Ngoc; next, my colleagues and friends, Commissioners Hahn and Andor, will speak in turn - in this debate in which we are participating - on the other oral questions which affect other sectors: cohesion, employment, the social dimension, research and development.
The Commission is proposing 5% in its capital adequacy review.
I voted for the resolution on the implementation of the EU Strategy for the Danube Region because it satisfies the need to improve mobility, energy security, environmental protection, social and economic development, cultural exchanges, security and civil protection in the region.
Mr President, the opinion that the European Parliament will vote now on the Commission's proposal for a directive on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation does not prejudice the final position that the Parliament will take with regard to the implementation of Article 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the consequences for the procedures based on Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999, especially as regards the regulatory procedure with scrutiny or the position that the Parliament may wish to take on delegated acts in other legislation.
There is exasperation in the road freight transport sector because each country has different rules on whether or not freight can be transported when driving back from abroad.
Therefore, every country that is seeking membership of the euro area or is already an established member should learn from Slovakia's example.
We therefore need to promote political dialogue between the EU and developing countries in order to encourage the incorporation of factors connected with climate change into plans for reducing poverty at local and national level.
Legislation on cultural industries, such as the protection of intellectual property rights and neighbouring rights, therefore always has to strike the right balance between culture's two social dimensions.
The reform in March 2004 was intended to organise air traffic in line with operational requirements, not national borders.
The next review of the common fisheries policy is due by 2012 and this report is a wake-up call that historic fishing rights are under threat in the North and Baltic Seas.
We will come with an initiative on executive pay, based on a review of our 2004 recommendation.
In fact, as the Court of Auditors says in this report, 95% of all expenditure is free of errors, except in the Structural Funds, where the level of error is higher.
In the interests of transparency, the creation of a system for the compulsory declaration of all meetings between registered organisations and the Members responsible for related legislation is equally important, and should be recorded in an annex to the respective reports or recommendations.
I urge the European Commission to take the required measures to support the agricultural sector in Martinique and Guadeloupe, especially the banana and sugar cane sectors, after their fruit plantations were almost completely destroyed, with disturbing social, economic and human consequences.
They provide a mechanism for tackling the massive illegal trade in timber.
We also support the proposal to reform the WTO in order to make it more effective and transparent and improve its democratic legitimacy once the Doha Round is over.
Implementation of the synergies of research and innovation earmarked funds in Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 concerning the European Fund of Regional Development and the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development - Delivering a single market to consumers and citizens - Long-term sustainability of public finances for a recovering economy - Contribution of the Cohesion policy to the achievement of Lisbon and the EU 2020 objectives (debate)
However, I would like to repeat a question that I raised during the debate on this report in the Committee on Transport and Tourism.
Too many workers' representatives are still deprived of the basic information and consultation rights as their employer refuses to grant them these rights.
I believe that the Secretary-General of the European Parliament must propose arrangements to ensure that use of the general expenditure allowance is transparent in all cases and that it is used for the purposes intended.
In connection with the two communications from the Commission on coordinating Member State systems of direct taxation on the internal market and retirement tax, ECOFIN adopted the December 2008 Council resolution on retirement tax. This resolution endeavours to eliminate double taxation and coordinates state procedures in the area of retirement tax so that, with the transfer of economic activities from one state to another, when assets of physical or legal persons are transferred from the state which applies the tax on exit, then the recipient state should apply the market value of the asset which was exchanged at the time of the asset transfer from the exit state as an expenditure when the asset is sold.
Therefore, we will support the development by the European Food Safety Authority of special methods for evaluating the risks involved before such food is authorised for sale.
It was essential that the resolution on the Late Payment Directive be accepted, and that is why I voted for the resolution.
In a globalised market such as the one in today's world it is impossible to believe that progress can be made using protectionist measures, and of course the European Union, as an economic stakeholder at world level, will only be able to have a strong economy if it continues to pursue measures to liberalise, construct and deepen the Single Market.
For example, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, we had a visit from the Swedish minister - who was President-in-Office of the European Council at the time - to deal with this issue the same day that we had the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control there, and these two people said completely different things.
The Court is also continuing to play an active part in fostering cooperation with the Supreme Audit Institutions in the Member States and is the lead body in a new working group dealing with common auditing standards and comparable auditing criteria designed for the EU context.
In terms of the overall picture, port expansions improve the environment by promoting maritime transport, which is more environmentally sound.
My question to the Presidency and the Commission is therefore: when will we see tangible proposals for a mid-term review that will have an impact on the non-existent budget margins for the remaining three years of this financial perspective, where the current ceilings prevent any reasonable action being taken to tackle the challenges that cannot wait until after 2013 and also a proposal drawing up guidelines for a long-term budget reform?
Pluralism in the media has now become an official requirement.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (CS) Madam President, Mr President, Commissioner, it is a great honour for me to have the opportunity to speak today.
Although we agree with the Communication from the Commission on an EU strategy for youth, I am concerned that, like many of the other strategies we have adopted, it may never be anything more than a set of fine declarations on paper.
This draft resolution refers to the implementation of Directive 2006/123/EC on services in the internal market.
Whether it be a question of taxing the financial industry, obtaining a fair contribution from large companies, implementing a climate-energy tax or tackling tax evasion and avoidance effectively, only a Europe-wide approach, as you know, will enable us to implement effective solutions.
The Member States are responsible for the financing and organisation of social protection systems, with the Commission supporting them in this task.
The Agreement will contribute to the successful implementation of the Water Framework Directive, to protecting the environment, improving the living standards of local inhabitants and strengthening good neighbourly relations in a particularly sensitive area of the Balkans.

Member of the Commission. - Madam President, Mr Freitas' report deals with a proposal that opens the way to the introduction of the principle of environmental impact assessments in the fisheries field.
I would also like to thank the President of the European Central Bank, Mr Trichet, for his good work, especially this year, which has been such a difficult one for Europe.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in the absence of new proposals from the Commission relating to oil exploration and extraction - an absence which I should immediately like to point out is quite legitimate since the Commission is engaged in ongoing consultations with the industry and the numerous regulatory authorities concerned - I can only reiterate here our deep concern following the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico and its far too numerous human and environmental casualties.
Mr President, on behalf of the UEN Group I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteurs, Mr Virrankoski and Mr Itälä, and to all members of the Committee on Budgets for their efforts in drawing up the budget and their excellent cooperation.
(ES) Mr President, I wish to thank Karl-Heinz Florenz and the entire working group for having brought in such high-level scientists to work on this issue.
However, a knowledge of history and respect for multiculturalism may act both as a cohesion instrument and as an incentive to growth for local communities, by calling on them to cooperate at local, regional, national and transnational level, as stated in the Commission proposal and as accepted by us.
in writing. - (FR) On 1 February 2007, when my report on promoting healthy diets and physical activity in the EU was adopted, the European Parliament delivered a number of strong messages, including the fundamental role of education in relation to nutrition and health in order to prevent overweight and obesity, which affects more than 5 million children, and the call for the Commission and the Council to take the necessary measures, within the framework of the review of the CAP (common agricultural policy) in 2008 and 2013, to enhance healthy nutrition incentives within the framework of rural development policies.
The aim is therefore to improve the existing directive, bearing in mind the new safety risks which may arise as a result of the development and marketing of new kinds of toy, possibly made from new materials.
However, the EU has already taken the first steps in the right direction with regard to illegal timber imports, biofuels and aviation emissions.
Fourthly, procedures and means to allow access by the customs authorities to information are laid down, since in most Member States these authorities play a principal role in ensuring compliance with the regulation, especially as regards controlling exports.
E-justice within this Parliament, and certainly within the Committee on Legal Affairs, also chimes in with the theme that we have long had close to our hearts, that of access to justice and how we provide access to justice on a cross-border basis.
Our House should not only react in the traditional fashion with an appropriate resolution, but should take specific action to discipline the Belarusian authorities and should appeal to Mrs Ashton to appoint, on the basis of Article 33 of the Treaty of Lisbon, a special representative to monitor breaches of human rights in Belarus.
I tabled an amendment calling for the level of management expenses and costs linked to creating and implementing the instrument not to exceed 5% of the value of each use so that the largest share of the money does not end up with financial intermediaries, but goes into investments for projects linked to energy efficiency in homes and the use of renewable energy resources.
I believe that, yesterday, the Council put a message across to the Commission concerning aid for the banks, and it is clear that we want flexible and quick decision-making regarding the support that can be given to the banks and the financial institutions in the current circumstances.
President-in-Office of the Council. - (SL) With regard to organisation at EU level I mentioned the EUNetPass network, which is one of the recommendations provided by the aforementioned Working Group for Patient Safety, and specifically that the EUNetPass network would be one of possibly several ways, but one of the ways of achieving patient safety.
The success of the new European structural reforms is closely linked to strengthening the single market.
I would like to welcome our new fellow Member and issue a reminder that, on the basis of Rule 3(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, until such time as her credentials have been verified or a ruling has been given on any dispute, Mrs Irigoyen Pérez shall take her seat in Parliament and on its bodies and shall enjoy all the rights pertaining thereto, provided that she has previously declared that she does not hold any office incompatible with that of Member of the European Parliament.

In the context of the negotiations conducted between the Romanian Government, the IMF and European Commission, legislative amendments were agreed on the special administration procedure to allow the National Bank of Romania to intervene rapidly and effectively when a credit institution is in difficulty.
However, I believe that we in the European Parliament were also able to help to enable this directive ultimately to end up in the Council with this result, which has already been described by many fellow Members as positive.
In itself, however, it is not a guarantee of social integration or the elimination of poverty.
What many people experience in real terms is less social security, stagnating wage levels, serious curtailment of employment rights, rising prices for basic services in local public transport, health provision, energy and water supplies, education and child care - all of this when the profits of large enterprises are rising at the same time as these enterprises are threatening to relocate.
Furthermore, in this connection it must be remembered that in the long term we must encourage the subsidising of public transport and the movement of goods by rail.
It should lead to more operational management of projects that often involve local authorities and concern environmental protection, innovation and energy for instance.
In many areas of the budget, mechanisms exist for recovering incorrectly made payments from beneficiaries or, where Member States have incorrectly administered expenditure schemes, 'disallowing' some expenditure, i.e. refusing to finance it from the budget.
However, we have doubts about the implementation of the proposal which states: 'The scope of the mutual recovery assistance should be extended to other taxes and duties than those already covered now, as the non-payment of any kind of tax or duty affects the proper functioning of the internal market.
Mr President, I am delighted that the High Representative will be the first and most senior foreign diplomat to visit Egypt, and following this debate she will take with her Parliament's support for the immediate release of political prisoners, for legal accountability for those responsible for the violent suppression of peaceful protest and for an asset freeze and other actions for the authors of past human rights abuse.
The Commission must also propose specific targets for narrowing the competitiveness gap between EU economies and, last but not least, go ahead with investments in green energy.
It goes without saying that economic divergences across euro-area countries cannot be addressed by monetary policy.
Public funding must be increased for research and development in order to mobilise private investment, while simplifying procedures and cutting red tape are a prerequisite for industry's increased involvement.
Finally, does the current crisis in the euro area and the lack of solidarity of Member States in tackling it present a threat to the success of this ambitious project?
For this reason, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs supports the simplification of the rules and quicker access to the Structural Funds and European Social Fund.
When we allocate funds for water infrastructure, priority must be given to those which include clean technologies, use water efficiently and also involve risk prevention measures.
Following the European Commission communication on the raw materials initiative, we have to strive to ensure that an ambitious common strategy is defined quickly for this sector.
To say that while we are going to make life easier for SMEs, employees remain at the heart of enterprise, that the Small Business Act must also be a chance to promote the place of employees in the way these businesses are managed.
Bearing in mind the need for the fishery to remain stable and predictable, and for fish stocks to be exploited within established limits, concern should be expressed that a ban on discards might be used to legalise the large-scale industrial fishing of under-sized cod in the Baltic Sea.
More regulation simply feeds this perception; more self-regulation and self-discipline is the answer.
It is clearly the case that they are seeking to weaken the Commission's proposal to benefit the industry.
As rapporteur for the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, I even proposed reduced VAT rates for products in the energy efficiency and renewable energy sector as well.
The emergence of new economies which differ greatly from each other, the generalised and globalised increase in consumption, the competition for essential goods and raw materials, the threat of social revolt, the risk of preference for muscular political regimes, all these new realities require analysis and, in particular, a more strategic proposal with a different view of the future.
It is, however, the crisis that prompts this urgent intervention.
That is why we listened with great interest when you said that the Commission is going to undertake coherent stock-taking of the social dimension of the internal market, the European Union's social dimension, this summer and will present the results of this process to us.
I am also convinced that the President of the European Council may not exactly appreciate, but will at least accept, with better grace than at the time of his last speech to the European Parliament, my departing from polite, conciliatory comments, this time in relation to the last European Council, in order to point out a few problems, because real politics implies a frank but respectful exchange of ideas.
Within this framework of possible action, it is suggested that major incentives are created for regions, which, up to now, have had an above-average role with regard to energy efficiency, promoting their energy independence and, on the other hand, encouraging the sharing of good practice between these regions and those having had little development in this area.
The objective of the impact and sustainable development assessment was to analyse the economic, social and environmental impact of the future free trade agreement and to identify any necessary support measures.
We are not opposed to this agreement in principle provided that Morocco agrees to end all human rights abuses in the illegally occupied territory of Western Sahara, that Morocco agrees to a free and fair referendum for the people of Western Sahara and that the fisheries partnership agreement is reviewed and the Saharawi population of Western Sahara are allowed to live as equal citizens of their Moroccan counterparts.
Next, in March 2009, I shall propose the review of a framework decision on the sexual exploitation of children, child pornography and the fight against trafficking in human beings.
The Commission hopes there will be the opportunity to redress this issue in the second reading.
Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law

Firstly, how does the Commission intend to promote and support migration to the SEPA payment instruments?
Therefore, I congratulate all scholars, and together with improved research mechanisms, we will move forward.
The common agricultural policy should be provided with appropriate market intervention instruments, because I think a strong common agricultural policy is the only guarantee of solving the problem of food security.
The first ingredient is strong market regulations and, from that point of view, Mr Van Rompuy, the developments with regard to financial market supervision and the positions adopted by the Council worry us greatly.
Parliament is concerned by the decrease of detailed information in the Court of Auditors' specific annual reports on the agencies and encourages the Court of Auditors in the future to include more complete information in its reports on the agencies, in particular as regards the conclusions of internal auditors' reports.

Also, I would like to say that Article 5 of the contractual obligations (Rome I) proposal is essential in order to determine whether the consumer protection legislation of the country of origin or of the country of the client applies.
It is, moreover, very important that we invest in research and new applications for different environmental technologies.
As a Liberal, I am, of course, in favour of allowing the internal market to work and of the minimum possible amount of government intervention in the market.
What this means is that all funds must be used in such a way that they guarantee security, prevention and sustainability, and there must be special attention paid to this.
We shall also be able to vote in favour of the fisheries agreement with the Union of the Comoros, although I do not wish to hide the fact that I would like to see a fundamental realignment of the partnership agreements within the framework of the reform of the common fisheries policy.
Secondly, in the interests of improved management and sustainable exploitation of marine resources and appropriate combating of climate change, enhancement of coastal areas, support for environmentally friendly forms of maritime transport and an effective port policy, support for marine research, promotion of social rights in line with previously agreed international requirements, lifelong learning and support for tourism, which is one of the fundamental activities in this maritime policy.

The reform is the fruit of negotiations with the Council, represented by the Czech presidency which, by the way, deserves my full praise, since it has had no shortage of political difficulties to face throughout its term of office; it is a combination of a structural reform of the directive, which does not affect the foundations of Parliament's mandate and which fully respects the principle of subsidiarity, since the directive establishes the principle of sanctioning actions in the terms defined by the Court of Justice ruling, while leaving Member States to define the types of penalties.
Ten years after the approval of the Ottawa Convention we can celebrate considerable progress in the achievement of its objectives.
in writing. - I welcome this report as I believe impact assessments to be a key instrument in the legislative process.

Commission representatives on the governing boards of agencies make every effort to ensure that the recommendations stemming from external evaluations, and those from the Court of Auditors and the Commission's internal audit service, are followed up appropriately.
My second question is as follows; has the Commission made any provision in the planned 2014-2020 financial perspective for support for geological research with a view to estimating the potential of existing deposits and the possibility of extracting shale gas in Europe, which will accelerate technological development in the field?
in writing. - (FR) I voted for the Becsey report because an extreme increase in excise duty on manufactured tobacco, as proposed by the Commission, especially in these times of serious crisis, would be damaging to employment in this sector in Europe.
We call on the members of the European Parliament to use their power and to help rescue a volunteer who has devoted much of his adult life to understanding a community in central Asia threatened with extinction.

Currently in fact, small and medium-sized enterprises, which mainly produce co-formulants, are denied room for manoeuvre precisely because of the excessive power of the major industrial groups - and not just in data management and exchange either.
The OSCE Troika, which included our own EP delegation, basically endorsed his victory, so we just have to accept this fact, even though we must strongly protest the repressive crackdown against the opposition demonstrators who accused the Government of monopolising the media during the campaign, using an outdated and unreliable electoral register - including many people who are supposed to be dead -and the disenfranchisement of the large diaspora abroad who were not able to vote.
In the next few years, our power and our responsibilities will increase significantly.
The instruments in this agreement could be applied not only to fishing vessels, but also vessels used for fishing related activities, such as transport vessels which may be used to carry fisheries products.

During the 20th century Arctic air temperatures increased by approximately 5°C, which is ten times faster than the observed global mean surface temperature.
If I could start with the report, I will look first at state aid.
However, until this strategy has been finalised, I believe that the decision to extend the transitional provision on the minimum VAT rate until 31 December 2015 is intended to reassure the business community, prevent structural imbalances in the European Union and encourage harmonisation of fiscal legislation.
We pay tribute to the positive results of the HRC, in particular the developments in the implementation of the universal periodic review, and the review of special procedures, as well as to the positive achievements of the Human Rights Council Presidency.
As we have said regarding the application of a global European satellite navigation system for transport, the use of this technology could represent an important contribution to the development, modernisation and diversification of public services, in the creation of opportunities for cooperation, and progress in science and its applications, and in the exchange and accessibility of information, with the guarantee of respect for the public's rights, freedoms and guarantees.
There are also rules regarding the liability of depositaries which prevent the creation of long, obscure chains of liability.

The Czech Republic is the only Member State of the EU yet to ratify the UN Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, and yet tobacco is responsible for over one million deaths in the EU.
Now, more than ever, we must maintain our position, Minister.
It is therefore shocking to see how the European Court of Justice is now trying to undermine the Danish justice and home affairs opt-out, and even more shocking is the fact that this Parliament can adopt a report - never mind that it is in contravention of my vote and that of the Danish People's Party - without even dealing with this matter - the matter that entails removing people's right to determine their own policy relating to foreigners and, in particular, in cheating and deceiving with regard to the promises that were originally given to a country like Denmark.
in writing. - (IT) I voted in favour of the proposal to establish a European Cormorant Management Plan to minimise the increasing impact of cormorants on fish stocks, fishing and aquaculture.

Once this legislation has been in force for two years, it is fully justifiable that the Commission should supply an assessment that is as extensive as possible, not only on the specific issues of the strict implementation of the regulations concerning transport, but also on the economic and social consequences for the regions and Member States with a low production capacity for some animal species that are important for human consumption.
Does it sanction the administrative expenses?
I firmly believe that the expansion of the register will also prove an inspiration for the Parliament of the Czech Republic.
In addition, we want EU production and the quality of that EU agricultural and food production to be defended in the World Trade Organisation.
As I cannot believe that the Commission is unaware of the importance of these aspects of competitiveness - indeed, in the framework of globalisation, logistics represent a greater cost for industry than does labour, to say nothing of the additional challenge posed by climate change - I trust that this time the Commission will take full note of paragraphs 27 and 16, on Galileo and innovation, so that we are able both to make full use of the beneficial synergy created by the Lisbon process between the Commission and the Member States and to make progress in European plans for sustainable transport, logistics and trans-European networks, especially in the cross-border sections which are always so overlooked.
The Treaty of Maastricht introduced aspects relating to justice and internal affairs at Community level, which had been dealt with strictly at intergovernmental level until then.
It is also just as important to increase the loans for the European network of employment services.
Furthermore, owing to the European Union's high degree of dependency on imports from third countries (60%), producers have very little or even no influence on the price levels of fisheries products.
With regard to the disappointments, I would mention, aside from the numerous derogations from the ban on carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic substances, the abandonment of the idea of certification by independent third parties.
We are in favour of the possibility of timely intervention when a terrorist act has not yet been committed - that is, beforehand - so that lives can be saved.
This is a different issue to those of the capital requirement for high-risk activities and the bank trading book, which are both at the root of the crisis.
The next item is the report by Mrs Van Brempt, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 663/2009 establishing a programme to aid economic recovery by granting Community financial assistance to projects in the field of energy - C7-0139/2010 -.
in writing. - (PT) Information from the register of activities shows that the Ombudsman received 3 830 complaints in 2006.
The Commission does not intend, of course, to force the Member States to offer incentives, but it does wish to coordinate the exchange of information and to propose a set of guidelines on this subject in order to prevent, precisely, fragmentation of the market.
As part of the overall compromise, I would like to propose the following text in relation to the risk assessment to bees: 'When revising the data requirements for active substances and plant protection products, as referred to in Article 8(1) (b) and (c), the Commission will pay particular attention to study protocols allowing a risk assessment which takes into account the real exposure of bees to these products, in particular through nectar and pollen.'
We will issue our study on Kosovo as part of our enlargement package in the autumn.
Information and communication technologies provide great opportunities to encourage growth and innovation, thus helping to implement the goals of the Lisbon Strategy and to overcome the current economic crisis; more than ever before, the European Research Area is the foundation of Europe's information society and is essential for removing inconsistencies in scientific research activities, programmes and policies in Europe; adequate funding is important to ensure the flow of qualified scientists able to move freely and to support global scientific research infrastructure, accessible to all teams of researchers across Europe.
The independence of the Central Bank must be protected, but that does not stop us from offering an opinion.
It is to the credit of representatives of the European Parliament that we are standing up today in defence of the rights of a Muslim minority in Burma.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - Madam President, let us be clear: this biomass thing is driven by the alleged global warming effect of man-derived carbon dioxide emissions.
The major powers of NATO and the EU, having imposed strangulatory economic and financial measures on Yugoslavia, with the support of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, supported ethnic divisions which ended in war and the hasty creation of new 'sovereign states'.
In this connection, let me say a few words about the Instrument for Stability.
I do maintain, however, that there are no grounds at all for the approach adopted here, whereby the main problem is the emission of carbon dioxide as the key greenhouse gas and that action by human beings can change, reduce or limit potential climate change.
We need to safeguard the existing requirements in terms of workers' rights and environmental protection when transposing the IMO Convention.
on behalf of the IND/DEM Group. - (NL) Madam President, as the rapporteur responsible for monitoring relations between the European Union and China, it pleases me enormously to see that paragraphs 80 and 87 of the present report dedicate substantial attention to the seriousness of the human rights situation in China.
Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (debate)
Finally, there is the deliberate opacity of the work of the IGC, which is as far as it could be from a public, transparent drafting of a text whose purpose is to determine the life and future of the EU of 27 and half a billion citizens.
In view of the fact that the reduction in CO2 emissions is mainly due to the increase in energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies in the transport and housing sectors, and in energy-intensive industries, can the European Commission state what concrete measures it has in mind to help the Member States stimulate investment in increasing energy efficiency and the use of renewable energies?
There is, of course, still a great deal we can do in terms of exchange of best practice.
I cannot respond fully to the questions on how to operate with surpluses under the present regime, but it might be a contribution to the discussion of the rules of the next financial perspective.
The reasons are complex and relate mainly to the lack of business risk capital.
For example, the PPE Group is looking forward to the proposals of the European Commission on greater economic coordination in terms of monetary policy.
Their plea for short-term aid has fallen on deaf ears, even though it lies within the power of the local minister to pay de minimis aid under state rules.
The great challenge of qualitative reform is and remains reinforcing own contributions and mutual accountability.
Debates on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law (debate)
Guaranteed funds should be backed by capital advocacy requirements and this should be addressed by only allowing funds to be called guaranteed if they are backed by an adequate guarantee arrangement.
After all, we are dealing here not only with State aid by the German Government - to the tune of EUR 4.5 billion - but also something that is both merger and acquisition.
We will only generate citizens' understanding for a European migration policy - for legal immigration - if we make it clear that when it comes to illegal migration, illegal migrants will have to leave Europe.
What we are seeing is that, in order for these countries to enter the euro area, harsh financial restructuring programmes are being applied, with the result that in Estonia today, drastic cuts in civil servants' wages are being applied, unemployment has reached 20% and unemployment among young people is many times higher.
All European countries - present and future members of the European Union - must engage in a concerted effort in order to overcome the historical social exclusion of the continent's largest ethnic minority and sign up for a community action plan which provides the proper legal leverage to force the participants to comply with their own pledges.
The majority of the EUFOR troops come from France, and France has a military agreement with Déby - who seized power in a military coup - and has aided him by supplying him with weapons and securing the airport against the rebel attack.
in writing. - (FR) My colleagues and I backed Giuseppe Castiglione's report on the common organisation of the market in wine by a large majority.
It also includes some positive recommendations, such as the need to fix a decent minimum wage, protect unemployment benefit and support people with disabilities, although it does not tackle the root causes of the social situation and does not call for an end to neoliberal policies, which we are proposing.
I, too, would stress that the European Parliament is not asking for an increase in expenditure or for more powers than those provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon.
The next item is the debate on the statement by the President of the European Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee - novel foods.
It is regrettable that the committee's amendments run counter the EU's role as a transparent institution.
International cooperation is therefore required between the tax authorities, involving the exchange of information on bank accounts.
It is important to improve access to green goods and technologies to achieve sustainable development objectives, and we must reach a rapid conclusion to the negotiations on reducing or removing tariff and non-tariff barriers for environmental goods and services so as to promote new forms of employment policies and create jobs which meet decent work standards as laid down by the International Labour Organisation and establish growth opportunities for European industries and small and medium-sized enterprises.
As Chairman, I have deleted the explanatory statement, in accordance with our Rules of Procedure, under Rule 48, because the rapporteur's explanatory statement bore no relation to the text passed by the committee.
In the EU, significant differences remain, and until they are evened out, the problem-free implementation of the idea of free movement of services or capital is unthinkable.
National accounts cover environmental considerations based on economic performance and the creation of prosperity.
The May 2005 'Council of Europe Convention on the Action Against trafficking in Human Beings' has only been ratified by nine countries, two thirds of women trafficked for prostitution come from Eastern Europe and yet, countries like the Czech Republic and Estonia have not signed the convention.
In other words, this text is much less ambitious than what we defended in the Conciliation Committee a few months ago and much less ambitious than what I would have wanted for passengers in Europe.
Consequently, within the framework of the Second Strategic Energy Review, what can be called connecting the energy islands in the European Union to the internal market has become one of the Union's key objectives.
In this respect, it is important to ensure that the first European radio spectrum policy programme is in line with the objectives already outlined in the EU 2020 strategy and the Digital Agenda and comes within the priority actions of the Single Market Act.
Worker mobility depends on the fundamental principle of the freedom of movement of persons within the internal market, in accordance with the Treaty Establishing the European Community.
While taking into account the reasons given by the College, in particular that it was difficult for this new Community body to meet the principles of the Financial Regulation straight away and that control systems have since been put in place, it would seem normal that, by June 2008 at the latest, this body should fully comply with the provisions of the Financial Regulation.
Firstly, power is transferred from the electorate and the popularly elected representatives to government officials and lobbyists behind closed doors in Brussels.
We will ensure that Parliament remains vigilant, and I thank the Commissioner for pointing out that alongside the provisions in the compromise on which we will be voting, the Commission wanted to provide information on the implementation of the framework directive on water and, if necessary and if any delays build up in the Member States or any doubts need to be raised, to present complementary measures to ensure that we do indeed achieve environmentally acceptable water in 2015, in line with our vote in 2000.
I hope that this message comes across very clearly, as today we have been talking about nanotechnology and cloning.
The EU has a coastal interest in the Indian Ocean and accordingly must fulfil obligations under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.
The Assembly consisted 'of representatives of the peoples of the States brought together in the Community', as stated in the Treaty of Rome, which had entered into force a few weeks earlier.
The European Systemic Risk Board is - if you allow me to make the comparison - somewhat akin to the Federal President of Germany.
The report also deals with the links between agricultural policy and fighting climate change.
In addition to everything that has been said in favour of this accession, I would like to stress two points that I feel are important: the establishing of a control outside the Union and the extraterritoriality of the convention; in other words, its application to all the acts of the Union, including outside EU territory.
As a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I think it is very important that we aim for a greater degree of harmony and synergy between regional and rural development policies in the future.
The main cause of this situation is that the basic criterion for the production of agricultural produce and food is profit rather than global food requirements.
Although more than nine Member States have indicated their intention to establish enhanced cooperation between themselves in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection, the Commission and the Member States participating should promote the participation of as many Member States as possible.
We have made a preliminary analysis of energy efficiency action plans, which are part of the package and sometimes a bit overshadowed by the legislative efforts.
The same attention, possibly even more, has to be paid to protecting personal data during a counter-terrorism investigation as it does when my personal data are revealed not to a court, but to a private industrial group.
It is high time the Construction Products Directive was reformed and replaced with a more workable regulation that would enable us actually to ensure the free movement of construction products in the internal market.
I support the conclusion of this Agreement in a spirit of cooperation, transparency and complementarity, in particular the establishing of a cooperation framework between the two institutions entailing regular contacts and meetings, exchange of information and coordination of activities in order to avoid duplication and to guarantee the best possible use of resources.
Mrs Patrizia Toia's report can help eliminate the suspicion legislators and market stakeholders have that the money and products generated by the social economy are simply organisations seeking to evade competition rules.
I voted in favour of the report on the performance and sustainability of the European aviation system, presented by my Romanian fellow Member Mr Marinescu.
However, it is important for all of us not to get confused, but be a little more conservative and not let go of two fundamentals of cohesion policy, namely, that it is an independent policy, the main objective of which is still, and will remain, the equalisation of development between less well-developed regions and the rest of the European Union, and second, that per capita gross domestic product by purchasing power parity is nevertheless the main criterion.
I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner whether the Commission has requested any studies on the causes of the rise in the price of animal feed and I would like to know, too, what proportion of the feedingstuffs imported in recent years has contained traces of GMOs not authorised in Europe and where these products came from.
Yet this was a textbook case: to oppose the opinion given by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).
This is achieved through constant monitoring of the performance of operators; hence, at this stage, a more stringent control framework is not deemed to be required by the Commission.
Despite the extensive improvements made by the rapporteur, I reject this proposal, because it infringes the principle of subsidiarity.
I am a strong supporter of a Common Agricultural Policy which secures a level playing field for all Member States.
After all, Europe and Canada have such strong economic links that Canadian industry, whether it wants to or not, must adapt to European environmental protection requirements in order to operate on the European market, for example in this area.
If we do not think carefully about the implications of some of these agreements, we will see more demand for migration and will end up debating migration rather than the issues we are debating here.
This is why we should, perhaps, adjust our priorities and projects, particularly in the context of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Development.
In this context, I would like to welcome the vision of the common agricultural policy outlined in the report.
(DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this is an appropriate and important project to realise energy efficiency and save more energy.
I regret that a further ten or twelve Members were not able to speak, but it is impossible given how late we are running and the Rules of Procedure we are bound by.
My wife works in the management of a car company in Germany, and in Austria people are pleased that Opel appears to have been rescued in this way.
(RO) First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Coelho for the exceptional work he has done on this report, which is so important to Romania and Bulgaria, and also make the following clarifications. Romania's adoption of the law aimed at regulating the processing of personal data is an important step towards meeting all the conditions for joining the Schengen area.
The second element is that developing countries will contribute to the reduction in emissions within the framework of sustainable development.
I was pleased to be able to vote in favour of the report, which, following the agreement with the Council during the second reading, will bring significant improvements in the free movement of patients within the European Union.
Our conclusions should be presented in the framework of a report on the functioning of the interinstitutional agreement which will be issued on the same date as the draft budget, 27 April, and sent to Parliament.
In the opinion it was proposed that Member States may appoint existing institutions to act as competent authorities and to utilise or extend existing procedures concerning cross-border payment services.
This is a modified directive, which simplifies and clarifies the rules for issuing securities, which supports small and medium-sized enterprises, as Mr Klinz just very properly reminded us, in accessing the capital markets, and which will help to reinforce the internal capital market.
Of course, much of what we currently complain about in relation to decentralisation or the rules for implementing the Financial Regulation results from Community decisions, for which we all bear our share of responsibility.
I would like once more to make it quite clear that the use of these weapons, including in countries where the European Union has police and military forces in operation, such as Afghanistan, Bosnia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, represent just as much of a danger to our mission as to the people themselves.
However, it would be a mistake to believe that the only purpose of the cohesion policy is to promote convergence, given that it is the most comprehensive integrated investment policy supporting the objectives of the 2020 strategy.
It is only by adopting an integrated approach which takes into account the interests and opportunities deriving from these interests of both Member States and the countries from the regions just mentioned that we can guarantee overcoming and averting crises, such as the gas crisis we have just been through.
A government that abdicates its duty to ensure the safety of its citizens violates their rights no less than a government that silences dissidents or imprisons accused criminals without trial.
In Parliament, many colleagues across the political groups have already demonstrated their involvement, but our duty is to put much greater political power into this issue.
Barely 8% of small and medium-sized enterprises export to destinations beyond their own national borders.
Currently, the majority of financial services are exempt from VAT.
It has an instrument for action, namely monetary policy; it acts with grace and determination.
I hope we are both pleased - and especially your husband with his enterprise - that money will finally be reaching the enterprises.
Finally, the draftsman would like to keep the legislative procedure for the decision on other communication and information exchange systems, including the mandatory opinion of the Court of Auditors, rather than apply the 'comitology' procedure.
It is the duty of Parliament to scrutinise the Commission and formulate political guidelines and not simply to behave like a debating society.
Implementing flexicurity means simultaneously guaranteeing flexibility and security for employees and employers.
The agreement and the subsequent convention adopted in 1990 are aimed at abolishing systematic controls on common borders and introducing a system where people can move freely.
Indeed, the expected decrease in the number of Europeans making an active contribution requires the EU to open its borders to third-country nationals, so that they can live and work here; otherwise the current social security systems will fail.
With this in mind, I think that lifelong learning programmes, such as Erasmus or Leonardo da Vinci, must receive more substantial financial support from the authorities in the coming years.
I voted in favour of the appointment of Dr Praet as an executive committee member of the European Central Bank (ECB) as he has shown that he is an excellent candidate.
I would also caution that the giving-up of certain rights under the world trade talks for short-term access to raw materials and commodities could be to the detriment of a lot of our industry in the European Union and in particular to our agriculture.
Because, the very day after the agreement last Sunday, the same story started that we have heard since the 11 February, with a series of comments on the inefficacy of the Greek measures and on the prospects for restructuring the Greek debt, with speculation as to whether the country might leave the euro area and, of course, with new attacks by the markets both on Greek bonds and on Portuguese and Spanish bonds.
Do this, and this will establish the link - Mrs Berès was just saying that this debate is a bit like a melting pot; fiscal coordination will help establish the link between the EU 2020 strategy, the report on the governance of the euro area, on the single market, and employment and education issues.
The term used in relation to the quotas from the perspective of common agricultural policy reform is "smooth landing”, meaning a gradual elimination of quotas.
Why does it not opt for a European solution in the case of Greece, as provided for in Article 122(2) of the treaties?
In contrast to the proposals of the European Commission, the decision to give life to a child cannot be considered simply as an individual goal involving fulfilment of the longing to have children.
Those sectors are voicing concerns, notably on aspects of the reform which they consider would - if the reform were approved - entail an increased concentration of powers in the hands of the President, a weakening of democratic control mechanisms and of the existing institutions and a threat to democratic pluralism.
I am also working with the European Investment Bank on that package, particularly regarding supportive infrastructure to try to develop them quickly and have quite a quick impact.
Therefore, I welcome today's initiative regarding the revision of EU instruments to support SME finance in the next programming period.
It notes with satisfaction that the maximum rate of financial aid for cross-border projects has increased to 30% and the minimum funding threshold to EUR 1.5 billion.
This is why such importance is attached to establishing a deep free trade area and to rapid action to reduce visa fees, with the proposal of visa liberalisation for a significant part of these countries as the ultimate goal.
Let me translate: light commercial vehicles are, of course, vans, and performance standards mean fuel emissions which depend on fuel burnt.
Although the time taken to set up a company has dropped in recent months, an analysis carried out by the European Commission has showed that over half of Member States still do not meet the requirement for it to be possible to do so in three days.
One of the most important issues is the abolition of the exequatur procedure.
The EIB achieved some positive results in 2009, when its activity increased by 40%, its funding for small and medium-sized enterprises increased by 55%, its funding for less-developed regions increased by 36%, and its funding aimed at combating climate change and promoting energy efficiency increased by 73%
It is therefore logical that that is where enormous potential for energy efficiency and for savings lies.
Potential for improvement at EP level: the main focus is the creation of an autonomous structure within the EP led by a supervisory board consisting of MEPs, possibly appointed at the beginning of each term, making use of the existing resources but also of seconded national experts.
In this context, the establishment of a lasting, transparent and democratic dialogue with civil society cannot be a mere pretext.
I would like to highlight the potential of regional 'clusters' of those leading the way in knowledge-based mobilisation of the capacity of regional competition, and the inclusion of the development of 'clusters' in both the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme and the 7th framework programme.
We will also come forward with proposals before the end of 2011 to step up training on the Arrest Warrant for police authorities, judicial authorities and legal practitioners in order to ensure consistency and effectiveness in the way it is applied and raise awareness of the new EU safeguards for procedural rights.
These cuts are proportionately more significant for Headings 1A and 4, and sent a negative message in the priority areas of growth in jobs and the EU's international role, not least in relation to pre-accession assistance.
This now requires an opinion from your Parliament, as well as from the European Commission and the Central Bank.
EUPOL is one of the most important assets we have as regards credibility and work in the field of security with the Palestinians and in the occupied territories, and it will continue to be an important asset of the European Union, winning recognition from all: from the Palestinians, the Israelis and the surrounding countries.
Liechtenstein has been part of the European Economic Area since 1995 and has been steadily integrating into the European trade area.
In the shape of the Court of Justice, the European Union, too, has a court, but, unlike the European Court of Human Rights, the Court of Justice is not solely responsible for protecting fundamental rights, and it is also not completely wrong to establish at this point that the Court of Justice did not, in the past, occupy the sole leading role in evolving European fundamental rights.
For example, I welcome forms which would give citizens the opportunity to add their name directly to the organ donor register when they apply for a driving licence.
In fact, the difference in prices between the beginning and the end of the food supply chain can be as high as a one to five ratio and, even if the liberals still refuse to admit it, the problems of the market need tackling to ensure reasonable prices for consumers and decent revenues for farmers.
From the point of view of European cooperation, it is regrettable that the ratification process of the Council of Europe's 2007 Convention has been so slow.
There has, however, been a standstill in the area of staff management, given that the objectives for staff and the performance indicators were neither measurable nor focused on results.
The Treaty of Lisbon has given the European Central Bank (ECB) the status of an EU institution, which increases the responsibility of Parliament as an EU institution through which the ECB is accountable to the European public.
Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy and Belgium are the main suppliers of arms to Colonel Gaddafi's army which is fighting the rebels in Libya.
For this reason, I would call on the Commission to present a legislative proposal on this - as soon as possible - with the dual purpose of simplifying the mobility of companies and ensuring that the matter of participation in relation to the transfer of a company's seat is not left up to the European Court of Justice.
The new Member States should take part in the preparation of plans for neighbourhood policy implementation activities, ensure a higher degree of participation by national parliaments and increase the activity of NGOs.
Yet it is precisely this uncertainty that indicates, for example, that we should take the first steps towards slowing down our carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere.
In the meantime, however, we can witness such a diversified development - in terms of the length of maternity leave, financing and the level of allowances - of various healthcare systems due to the combination of maternal and parental leave that it is now practically impossible to find a common denominator.
The lack of identity of the area itself and the traditional sensitivities of certain EU countries towards Russia, both political (for example Ukraine, Moldova, the Southern Caucasus and the frozen conflicts) and economic (the increased European dependence on Russian gas and the delicate status of the EU-Turkey negotiations), are probably among the reasons why the EU has limited itself to synergy instead of strategy.
in writing. - (FI) I strongly support the environmental impact assessment for the Nord Stream gas pipeline proposed in the Committee's report.
However, the line taken by the report is to facilitate company access to the natural gas transmission networks, that is, facilitate the privatisation of what is left of the public sector and place it at the service of the strategy of economic groups that want to enter the market.
If citizens have no means of monitoring expenditure by administrators, an atmosphere of greed and self-enrichment can result.
You are certainly right in saying that it is our duty to ensure that Kosovo become once more multiethnic and democratic.
the report by Mrs Mathieu, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Agency for Reconstruction for the financial year 2008 (SEC(2009)1089 - C7-0183/2009 -,
The Committee on Budgets met our demands, and even, in line 130616 relating to the European Regional Development Fund, asked for an increase in payments of EUR 900 million.
The changes to financial market regulation and market supervision represent a whole chapter in the effort to combat the current financial and economic crisis.
I voted in favour of Amendment 2 initiated by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) because a large number of producers have already started to invest with a view to modernising their rearing systems or are at the point of launching such investments.
I know Mr McCreevy does not agree, but I think it is really high time now to look into possibilities of regulation - not to over-regulate, not to panic, but really to conduct a serious study.
The interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006 allows the mobilisation of the EGF within the annual ceiling of EUR 500 million.
A situation in which a public institution of a Member State admonishes an MEP for words which he spoke in connection with the performance of his duties as an MEP is unacceptable.
So it is indeed a fact that, within the banking sector at the moment, we are also approaching the banks with restructuring and viable business plans for the future.
You are part of Schengen, you are part of the euro area, and it really is a historic Council Presidency, of which I make the request that you do not do as all the others before you have done and present a programme that even a large country would not be able to accomplish in six months.
This is why I fully endorse the statement made by the President of the European Parliament, Mr Buzek, in which he condemns these crimes.
I agree with the objectives and principles applied in the common fisheries policy, but I believe all coastal Member States must guarantee the right balance between socio-economic value and protection of ecosystems.
the recommendation for second reading by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on the Council common position for adopting a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 2002/22/EC on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks, Directive 2002/58/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws (16497/1/2008 - C6-0068/2009 - (Rapporteur: Mr Harbour),
However, we must also realise that European businesses are in a global competition, and that, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises and, above all, for research and development, it is particularly important to build bridges, and we need to ensure that competition does not turn into mutual destruction, to the advantage of businesses in other areas of the world which, in addition, do not always practise very fair competition with respect to their competitors.
The Commission has therefore initiated an infringement procedure in accordance with Article 228 of the Treaty.
in writing. - (PT) I voted against the Schnellhardt report on the hygiene of foodstuffs because I consider that the Commission's proposed amendment of Regulation (EC) No 852/2004, aimed at exempting small and medium-sized enterprises operating in the food sector from the application of the HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point) system, is not currently justified given that to date there is no evidence of specific problems with the application of this procedure.
Since the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact are so rigorous, how did the EU come to have a deficit of 7% and debt of 80% of GDP?
For this purpose, the Commission will evidently examine any observations submitted to it by the Member States or by the Working Party established under the directive.
The potential for massive catastrophe and the lack of a safe way to dispose of spent nuclear fuel means that nuclear power does not represent a safe means to develop energy production.
It is intended to form the basic element of the new anti-grassroots EU Competitiveness Pact designed to demolish European social security systems and replace them with private, individualised insurance, a new cash cow being milked at the workers' expense for the benefit of capital.
One of the main measures is for Member States to appoint cooperation authorities and special liaison organisations in order to cover the various aspects of social security in cross-border relations.
Furthermore, a predictable unfettered increase in traditional exports, concentrated in raw materials such as copper, sugar, copra, fish and palm oil (agro-fuels!) is entirely at odds with sustainable development needs.
The expert groups have already started deliberations on the issues mentioned, and the Europol working group and the committee are also continuing deliberations according to article 36.
Traditionally, rural areas could be differentiated from urban areas through their lower population density, different employment structure, lower level of income and poorer access to public roads.
The first is that I consider the CAP an important instrument that should be maintained even after 2013, because it supports enterprise.
In addition, it is important that the directive is neutral in technological terms, in that it should not specifically encourage the use of any particular fuel or technology.
The first point is on the substance of the proposals: it is hard to see what added value the European Union would bring to a project initiated, quite legitimately, by a number of Member States - aside from making the process more bureaucratic and setting up a new Community body.
Mr President, I am pleased to note from Commissioner Damanaki's reply that aquaculture will play an important role in the new common fisheries policy.
The economic crisis that has befallen the EU, and which is still being felt quite strongly, has revealed some gaps in Community monetary policy and in the public finances of certain Member States.
Europe's task is to construct a social and economic model that produces low carbon dioxide emissions, as Europe is among those with the greatest potential to develop the necessary technologies.
Binding targets mean only unnecessary and very often ineffective expenditure; it is better to convince citizens, institutions and bodies that savings in this area have a bearing on people's security and quality of life, too.
I believe that we need to increase our reduction target from 20% to 30% and we need mandatory targets for energy efficiency.
However, this instrument merits further analysis and discussion at technical and political level; moral hazard implications for Member States need to be further examined, in particular.
Essential opportunities for increasing gross energy efficiency are, however, to be found in physical and chemical industrial processes, which are based on: 1) better use of heat streams from fossil or nuclear fuels by a) transferring Carnot cycle conversion to a higher temperature and pressure, b) using appropriate recuperation of waste heat, e.g. in cogeneration processes; 2) reducing Ohm resistance during the transmission of current; 3) reducing heat resistance in heat exchangers; 4) increasing heat resistance by using insulating materials in construction; 5) reducing friction resistance; 6) reducing magnetic field losses; 7) shortening excessively long energy conversion chains.
We are familiar with the case law of the Court of Justice and we are fully aware of the fact that the Commission was proposing not to change the Treaty in order to avoid creating difficulties.
(FR) Mr President, an administrator's post in the European Parliament information office in Luxembourg has been vacant for more than two years.
It also has to be said that the current crisis is precisely the result of years of blindness to the reliance of the fisheries sector on fuel - and cheap fuel at that - and to the headlong rush to a kind of arms race, with ever more powerful vessels that can go out further and further and bring back ever greater quantities of fish.
I therefore very much welcome the introduction of the common register of lobbyists and lobbying organisations.
