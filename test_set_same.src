Nevertheless, while continuing this overall effort to reduce emissions, we must not forget the differences that exist between Member States and the specificities of each, such as the respective productive systems and conditions of production, as well as the ability to implement the necessary adaptations in technology and productive processes.
However, if we do not have an agreement, or if it is not ambitious enough, then there are provisions in our proposal that permit us to assess the situation and, accordingly, either provide emissions allowances for up to 100% of the allocations of these energy-intensive industries or permit the inclusion of importers into our emissions trading system and, of course, the obligation to pay for similar amounts of allowances as local producers will do, so equalising the situation - or even a combination of these measures.
